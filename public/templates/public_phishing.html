                            More than two thirds of organisations do not comply with Email Security Best Practices. It is no surprise then that over 91% of successful cyber attacks start with a simple phishing email. We provide a complete solution to protect your organisation from email based attacks.
                        </p>

                        <p>There is no fool proof technological defence against these attacks. Training to recognise and resist targeted social engineering scams is the single most effective defence you can deploy. Behavioural changes that improve an organisations security profile, maintain heightened employee awareness and reduce the likelihood of a successful cyber-attack are directly related to frequency of Phishing Simulations.</p>
                        <p>Phishing simulations are a "hands on training" exercise. By conducting phishing simulations, email users can experience directly and safely how phishing attacks occur. They learn the techniques used in these social engineering scams and how to identifiy them. In doing so they become your frontline of defence and empowered to safeguard their personal information and the information of their organization.</p>

                        <h3 style="padding-top:30px">How Simulations Work</h3>
                        <p>Employees receive phishing emails identical to those an attacker would use. Should they fall victim to one of these "simulated" phishing emails they are directed to a landing page that provides training on how to identify genuine phishing emails in the future. Regular simulations ensure that all employees are aware of the risks and remain vigilant against such attacks.</p>
                        <p>Dynamically created personalised landing pages provide a superior end user experience ensuring that your employees are fully engaged. Our bespoke phishing simulation and awareness service is effective and realistic. We identify your most likely threats and execute simulations based on real world scenarios.</p>
